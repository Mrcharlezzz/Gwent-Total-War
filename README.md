# GWENT-TOTAL-WAR

## Introduction
GWENT-TOTAL-WAR is a strategic card game developed in Unity, inspired by the popular Gwent card game from The Witcher series. This game features a unique blend of personalized rules and a thematic backdrop of Rome vs Greece, allowing players to engage in tactical battles using custom-built decks.

## Game Overview
GWENT-TOTAL-WAR combines elements of strategy, resource management, and card play. Players will face off in exciting matches where they can utilize their decks and leader abilities to outmaneuver their opponents.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Turn Logic
- Each player takes turns playing a card or activating their leader ability.
- Players can choose to pass their turn, indicating that they do not wish to play any more cards in the current round.
- The game continues until both players pass their turns, at which point the round concludes.

### Winning Conditions
- The game is played in a best-of-three format.
- The player who wins 2 out of 3 rounds is declared the winner of the game.

## Card Compiler Feature

### Gwent Language
- GWENT-TOTAL-WAR includes a powerful card compiler that allows users to create custom cards using the Gwent Language.
- This language is designed to be intuitive and flexible, enabling players to define unique abilities and effects for their cards.

### Creating Custom Cards
- Users can compile any card they wish to create by following the specifications outlined in the compiler files.
- Detailed instructions on how to use the compiler and examples of card definitions are provided in the [card creation guide](card_creation_guide.pdf).
